Such buffers are automatically written to disk or kept in memory until the size stored in the attribute `fMaxVirtualSize` is reached. Variables of one branch are written to the same buffer. A branch buffer is automatically compressed if the file compression attribute is set (default). Branches may be written to different files (see `TBranch::SetFile`). <br>\n",
